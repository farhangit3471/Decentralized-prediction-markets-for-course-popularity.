## Project Title
**Decentralized Prediction Markets for Course Popularity**

## Project Description
The **Decentralized Prediction Markets for Course Popularity** is a smart contract-based decentralized application (dApp) running on the Ethereum blockchain. This project allows users to place bets on how popular a university course will be based on enrollment numbers or any other predefined metric. Once the actual popularity is revealed by the course administrator, users who made accurate predictions are rewarded.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to create a decentralized, transparent prediction market for university courses. It aims to engage students in predicting the popularity of different courses, helping them make informed decisions while offering rewards for accurate predictions.

## Key Features
- **Place Bets on Course Popularity**: Users can place bets predicting the popularity of a course.
- **Course Finalization**: The course owner finalizes the actual popularity after the course is completed or enrollment numbers are known.
- **Rewards for Correct Predictions**: Users who predict the correct popularity are rewarded with double the amount they bet.
- **Decentralization**: Entirely decentralized and operated through a smart contract.
- **Secure and Transparent**: Built on the Ethereum blockchain to ensure fairness and transparency.
- **View Bets**: Users can view all bets placed for a specific course.

## Future Improvements
- **Frontend Development**: Build a user-friendly web interface to allow students to place bets and view results in real-time.
- **Leaderboard**: Create a leaderboard to show the top betters who made the most accurate predictions.
- **Advanced Reward System**: Implement a fractional reward system where users are rewarded based on how close their predictions are to the actual course popularity.
- **Multiple Course Support**: Extend the functionality to allow betting on multiple courses simultaneously.
